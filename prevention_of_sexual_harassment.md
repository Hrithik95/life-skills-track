## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
  If you happen to be facing or witnessing any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior, it is essential to take appropriate action. Here are steps you can consider:

3. **Report the incidents:** Report the behavior to the appropriate authorities or organization responsible for addressing such issues. This could be your supervisor, human resources department, or a designated reporting channel. Follow the established reporting procedures and provide them with documented information.

4. **Seek support:** Reach out to trusted individuals such as friends, family, or colleagues who can provide emotional support during this time. Additionally, consider seeking professional support, such as counseling or therapy, to help process your experiences.

5. **Know your rights:** Familiarize yourself with the laws and policies related to sexual harassment in your jurisdiction or organization. Understand your rights and the available avenues for recourse.

6. **Collaborate with others:** If you witness incidents, support the individuals affected by offering your assistance and encouraging them to report the behavior. Consider collaborating with others to raise awareness and advocate for a safe and respectful environment.
