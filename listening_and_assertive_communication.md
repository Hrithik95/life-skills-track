## According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?
### According to Fisher's model, the key points of reflective listening are:
- **Attending:** This means giving the speaker your full attention, both verbally and nonverbally. You should make eye contact, nod your head, and avoid distractions.
- **Understanding:** This means trying to understand the speaker's point of view, even if you don't agree with it. You should ask clarifying questions and paraphrase what the speaker has said to make sure you understand them correctly.
- **Reflecting:** This means restating the speaker's thoughts and feelings in your own words. This helps the speaker to feel heard and understood, and it also helps you to better understand their perspective.
